#note
# Pandas was built on top of numpy, all data are not array which makes pandas an essential library to data process

# index axis=0 is a row , index axis=1 are columns

# a data set is given to us, now we process these data, the first thing is to look into the table like in a relational database and then differentiate types of their columns

#another thing we can do is perform statistical operations on the data

# median, 50th percentile
#mean
#variance, how much variance means how much spread is in the data

#Skewness

#we can perform various statistical operations with pandas
